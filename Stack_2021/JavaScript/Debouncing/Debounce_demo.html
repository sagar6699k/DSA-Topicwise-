    <h2>Debouncing Demo :</h2>
    <h3>-In debouncing, the event will be executed only after the last click, no matter how many time you click the button.</h3>
    <h3>-It basically used to avoid the unneccessary action</h3>
    <h5>Ex: lets consider you are building a shopping cart, there need to click on purchase button, imagine if user clicked on purchase button twice or thrice accidently , then in such case event will be executed that much of time. So to avoid such case Debouncing technique will be usefull.</h5>
    <button onclick="Debouncing(Display, 2000)">Click Me</button>
    <h3>Open the console</h3>

<script>


let timerId;
function Display() {
    console.log('You clicked me');
}

const Debouncing = (fun,delay)=>{

    if (timerId) {
        clearTimeout(timerId);
    }

    timerId = setTimeout(()=>{
        fun();
    },delay)
